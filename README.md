# wiz3D "We See 3D"

A universal stereoscopic 3D wrapper for DirectX 7-11, OpenGL, AMD HD3D, and Nvidia 3D Vision. Based on iZ3D. 

**iZ3D** meant "**I** See 3D", so **wiz3D** means "**We** See 3D"

## What Is This?
wiz3D is an open-source stereoscopic 3D wrapper that hooks into DirectX, OpenGL, and AMD HD3D native and Nvidia 3D Vision games to generate real-time stereo 3D output (Half Side-by-Side, Anaglyph, Simulated Reality, etc.) without requiring kernel drivers or proprietary hardware or software.

iZ3D was a commercial product (~2002–2010) and one of the pioneers in modding games for stereoscopic 3D using kernel-level driver injection. The original developers kindly open-sourced the code under the MIT license, hosted by [bo3b/iZ3D](https://github.com/bo3b/iZ3D).

This project modernizes that source code, replaces kernel-level hooks with a proxy DLL loader, and expands the scope to re-enable stereoscopic 3D in games that have native AMD HD3D and Nvidia 3D Vision support.

## Current Status

* **AMD HD3D:** ✅ **Mostly Working!** HD3D games render stereo interally, so all that's needed is proxy to enable that rendering, capture the quad buffer output, and display it using modern stereo3D standards. The Proxy chain is successfully triggering stereo3D and capturing the quad buffer output. All that remains is getting that quad buffer output to display corrently in modern formats like Top-and-Bottom and Side-by-Side. Currently Half TAB and Half SBS is supported with about half the games, the other games still need work displaying the output correctly.
* **Nvidia 3D Vision 'Direct Mode':** ✅ **Partially Working.** DirectX11 games currently working, DX9 and 10 games to com. Tomb Raider not wearing to SR currently.
* **Nvidia 3D Vision 'Automatic Mode':** ✅ **Partially Working.** These are games that rlied on Nvidia's driver stereo injection. The ones listes speciffically have 3D Vision ingame settings, shader fixes and config settings. current aim for these is to inject stereo via iZ3D instead, and make the ingame settings and shaderfixes apply to iZ3D. Currently, enable/disable settings do work. But convergance and seperations liders aren't hooked up to iZ3D, and shader fixes arnt triggering yet.
* **DirectX 9:** ✅ **Mostly Working!** `d3d9.dll` proxy loader works! Left 4 Dead 2 and many others run in full stereo3D, outputs in all originally supported formats, and the profile system loads shader fixes and stereo settings for all originally supported games.
* **DirectX 8:** ✅ **Partially Worikng.** Wrapper to convert DX8 to use DX9's stereoization. One tested game working, needs further testing.
* **DirectX 7:** ⚠️ **In Progress.** Wrapper to convert DX7 to use DX9's stereoization. DX7 to DX9 converstion is working. Here for testing.
* **DirectX 10/11:** ⚠️ **Partial.** The DX10/11 wrapper was never completely finished by iZ3D Inc. Some games work, but implementation in wiz3D still has some way to go and hasn't got any games booting with stereo3D initialised yet.
* **OpenGL Quad-Buffer Stereo:** ⚠️ **In Progress.** Similar to HD3D and 3D Vision 'Direct Mode', OpenGL Quad-BufferStereo acts as a ssurface for games that supported OpenGL Quad -buffer to display their stereo 3D onto, and then convert it to display onto any screen. This tends to be legacy older titles such as _Quake_ and _American McGee's Alice_. This does not inject stereo into OpenGL games.

## Getting Started Playing

1. Launch game before downlaoding, and set the resolution and refreshrate, and make sure fullscreen is enabled.
1. Download the latest release from the **Releases** tab.
2. Find the executable (`.exe`) of the game you want to play, and check the API, Bitness and HD3D/3DVision support so you know which files to use.
3. Copy the **contents** of the appropriate `wiz3D` subfolder (e.g., the contents of the `dx9` > `x86` folder for a DX9 32-bit game) directly into the folder containing the game's `.exe`.
4. Launch the game. Stereo 3D should activate automatically! If it's an HD3D game, you may need to activate `stereoscopic 3D` or `HD3D` in the in-game menu.

Configure your output mode (Half Side-by-Side, Anaglyph, etc.) and any other settings you'd like to modify using the included `Config.xml` file.

### Nvidia 3D Vision "Automatic Mode" Games 
Games that used 3D Vision "Automatic Mode" driver stereo injection, but communicate with 3D vision with a ingame settings, built-in shader fixes, or config options. For our release, these use wiz3D's stereo injector instead, with the aim of making any shaders fixes and seperationa nd convergance sliders compatible with our injector in the future. Enable/disable settings should work currently.

## Building from Source

### Prerequisites

- **Visual Studio 2026** with the "Desktop development with C++" workload (v145 toolset)
- **Windows 11 SDK** (10.0.26100 or later)
- Git

### External SDKs (not included — download separately)

Several SDKs are excluded from the repository due to licensing or size. Download them and place them at the paths shown before building:

| SDK | Path in repo | Where to get it |
|-----|-------------|-----------------|
| Immersity LeiaSR SDK Win64 v1.36.2 + Win32 v1.34.10 | `lib/Simulated Reality/` | [https://support.immersity.ai/sdk/](https://support.immersity.ai/sdk/) and [Samsung Odyssey 3D Hub Installer](https://www.samsung.com/uk/support/model/LS27FG900XUXXU/#downloads) |
| NVAPI SDK | `lib/NVAPI/` and `lib/nvapi_2026/` | [https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvapi](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvapi) |
| Boost 1.87 | `lib/boost/` | [https://www.boost.org/releases/1.87.0/](https://www.boost.org/releases/1.87.0/) |

`lib/PerfSDK/` is a deprecated NVIDIA proprietary SDK; all code referencing it is `#if 0`'d out, so you don't need it to build.

### Solutions

There are two solutions to build:

| Solution | What it builds |
|----------|---------------|
| `S3DDriver.sln` | All stereo wrapper DLLs, output method DLLs, NvApiProxy, vendor proxies |
| `wiz3D-proxy/wiz3D-proxy.sln` | Entry-point proxy loaders: `d3d8.dll`, `d3d9.dll`, `d3d10.dll`, `d3d11.dll`, `d3d12.dll`, `ddraw.dll`, `dxgi.dll`, `opengl32.dll`, `vulkan-1.dll` |

Build both in **Release \| Win32** for 32-bit games, or **Release \| x64** for 64-bit games.

#### One-shot build + deploy (recommended)

Run from the repo root in PowerShell:

```powershell
.\bin\build_and_deploy.ps1                # both archs, both solutions
.\bin\build_and_deploy.ps1 -Arch Win32    # x86 only
.\bin\build_and_deploy.ps1 -Arch x64      # x64 only
.\bin\build_and_deploy.ps1 -SkipBuild     # deploy only (after a manual VS build)
.\bin\build_and_deploy.ps1 -SkipProxy     # only build S3DDriver.sln
```

This builds both solutions and copies every freshly-built DLL into the right `releases/wiz3D/<api>/<arch>/` subfolder for you. If you'd rather drive MSBuild yourself (or use VS's F7), run `.\bin\deploy_to_releases.ps1` afterwards to populate the release tree.

### Testing a Build

1. Build both solutions (or run `.\bin\build_and_deploy.ps1`).
2. Copy the **contents** of the appropriate `releases/wiz3D/` subfolder (e.g. `dx9/x86/`) directly into the game's `.exe` folder.
3. Set `wiz_Config.xml` or `HD3D_Config.xml` to match your display specifications
4. For some games (L4D2, Portal, HL2), copy into the `bin/` subfolder instead.
5. Launch the game. stereo should activate automatically.
6. Toggle Stereo on and off using `*`.

## Contributing

Contributions are very welcome. Key areas where help is most needed:

1. **Game testing** — test with DX7-11 and OpenGL games and add results to the tables above
2. **DX10/11 completion** — the DX10/11 wrapper was never fully finished by iZ3D, they closed first year of DX11's release. Debugging and completing it is a major effort but very valuable
3. **DX7/8 stereo** — basic wrappers pass through to DX9 but stereo initialisation isn't working yet
4. **OpenGL stereo** — Wrapper needsfurther building and fleshing out
5. **Output modes** — test the various stereo output plugins (SBS, anaglyph, interlaced, shutter)

Please open an issue before starting large changes. For game test results, edit the tables in `README.md` directly and open a PR.
