# wiz3D - build_and_deploy.ps1
#
# One-shot: builds both wiz3D solutions (S3DDriver.sln + wiz3D-proxy.sln) for
# one or both architectures (Release), then runs deploy_to_releases.ps1 to
# copy every freshly-built DLL into releases/wiz3D/<api>/<arch>/.
#
# Usage:
#   .\bin\build_and_deploy.ps1                # both Win32 + x64, both slns
#   .\bin\build_and_deploy.ps1 -Arch Win32    # x86 only
#   .\bin\build_and_deploy.ps1 -Arch x64      # x64 only
#   .\bin\build_and_deploy.ps1 -SkipBuild     # deploy only (no rebuild)
#   .\bin\build_and_deploy.ps1 -SkipProxy     # only build S3DDriver.sln
